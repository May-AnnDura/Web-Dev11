<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<hr> 
<p>I am <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mayann.dura2/">May - Ann Dura,</a> hailing from Samar. I am presently pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in University of Cebu. I have learned to be very hard-working as well as passionate about my dreams from the very core. Since my childhood, I have always been trained to focus on my passion. It is my mother who taught me to be courageous in difficulties and keep myself motivated. My mother is a teacher and my father is a self-employed man. It is truly said, that ambiance judges your capability. Seeing my mother being very punctual and dedicated to her profession and always caring to the people I have always tried to keep myself be a very helpful and humble person.
<br> 
Also, as we talk about family, the immediate next people we think about in our lives, are our friends. The contribution of friends and never be ignored. I always have the back of my few friends who are with me, through the thick and thin. Even in my school days, I was always motivated by my friends to discover myself. So, I can say that I am pretty satisfied with my surroundings and I’m really grateful to God for giving me a supportive ambiance altogether in my life. My school has always given me holistic development and helped in building my personality and skills. It made me what I am today. Your future is decided, by what you do today and it is the power of the present that helps you show your future. So, Without action, a dream will always be a dream. It’s your action that makes your dream work.
<br> 
It’s not necessary to only complain about what life has not given you, rather than it is to find out what life has actually in store for you. God has given everyone the potential and it is in our hands how we use it. We weave our present to see a beautiful design in the future.</p>

<h1>What Is My Favorite Hobby?</h1>
<hr> 
<p>I have a lot of hobbies to pass my time. One of such things is drawing. Even when I was a little child, drawing has always made me happy. Sitting quietly in a place, I can draw for hours. It keeps me busy and relaxes my mind. There is a little secret to why I love drawing so much. As a person, I am less talkative. Because of that, there are very few friends in my life. The thing is that, instead of speaking out everything, I prefer to express my emotions silently. And drawing just helps me do that.</p>

<h1>What Is My Favorite Movie?</h1>
<hr> 
<p>Watching films is one of my favorite things to do. I watch films in my free time, and I usually do it for enjoyment in order to reduce my stress due to the excessive amount of tasks I had from school. I love to watch action and romantic movies, because I personally find both types of movies very interesting. Through today’s technology especially the Internet, I can easily find out about new movies.
One of my favorite films would be The Fault in Our Stars. I have seen the film twice, and I am always in floods of tears by the end because it is so tragic. This film is based on the novel The Fault in Our Stars by the American writer John Green, which I must admit, haven’t actually read because it’s extremely long. I also love to watch anime and I have a few recommendations!</p>
